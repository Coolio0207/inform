Hi,



I need a python script that will cancel an NFT-listing on Looksrare when it is run and after the listing is canceled, it relists the NFT for sale.



I can write the rest of the code myself, but I can't figure out how to do this bit.



I want to avoid using selenium, and want the code to be connected to looksrare API to send the transaction/signed message with web3.py.

Thank you

Est. Budget: $100.00

Milestone 1: Python code to cancel and make NFT-listings on looksrare

Amount in escrow: $100.00

Perfect. I have sent you a proposal

This account has a worthless NFT that can be used to list and delist in the script. I will transfer some gas money.

Hi, Kristine Vik Andresen

I would like to ask some questions to you

Are you available to chat now?

KA
Kristine Vik Andresen 12:13 PM
Yes ðŸ™‚

Walter Nino 12:14 PM
I thought looksrare api would be almost same as opensea/seaport

so I guessed I can use sth like "cancelOrder" of seaport

I have take a deep look at looksrare apis

and I found out there is no cancel operation at the looksrare apis

but I have a solution

I think I can make a call to the exchange contract of looksrare

Cool

KA
Kristine Vik Andresen 12:17 PM
Yes, that should work. I just want to avoid selenium

Walter Nino 12:17 PM
Cool

Is there any chance to take a look of your existing code?

Or should I make my own code from scratch?

KA
Kristine Vik Andresen 12:19 PM
I would like it from scratch please. A separate code and all that it does is to list the nft and then delists it when the code is ran.

Here is the account with one nft that can be listed and delisted:

Let me read your msg again

Ok

Btw, I cannot find pip module for looksrare

There is only looksrare typescript sdk

Can you let me know the looksrare python module?

I have no idea how to do this, which is why I have posted this job. Maybe it can't be done without selenium.....

I know how to do it with selenium myself, but wanted to avoid chromedriver since pravate key is involved

What about to use web3.js or ethers instead of web3.py?

Your project is a python project?

KA
Kristine Vik Andresen 12:25 PM
Yes, it's a python project

But is it possible with web3.js or ethers?

Walter Nino 12:26 PM
Yes , javascript or python are both possible

I will use web3.py

no problem

Let me clarify again

KA
Kristine Vik Andresen 12:28 PM
great

Walter Nino 12:28 PM
I will make a script that will cancel listing when the nft is listed

KA
Kristine Vik Andresen 12:29 PM
It should delist an active listing and then relist the same nft again with a different price

Walter Nino 12:30 PM
Got it

When I have updates, I will let you know soon
