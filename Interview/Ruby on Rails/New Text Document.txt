This is Antonio Davis from Belgium.
I was born in chinese and I moved here when I was 15.
I started my programming language with Ruby on Rails.
And it is about 6 years now. I am confident in all RoR projects for backend and fullstack.
I didn't worry about the test exactly.
I was sure ,I could have a high marks and I would pass the test but the result was not good .
I am afraid I had disappointed you.
But please let me explain about that.
When I frist faced the test questions , I frightened.
the question was too basic and no-related  with developing.
Let me explain about this with one example question of test.
The one question was about the condition function using "begin and when".
In Ruby, there are 4 methods for loop funtions.
for, each, until and begin.
Developers are using for in normal and I also used to develop projects using that.
So I couldn't answer that question.
This is the reason why I couldn't get high result.
