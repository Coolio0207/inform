# HR interview

**Talking about my self**  

I am a senior software engineer for about 9 years of experience.

So far I have been getting old as a professional web application developer.
Through the years of experience, I’ve built tons of landing pages and led many web applications with react and react native.

Well I started my developement building pixel perfect landing pages with responsive design.

And when I was at mid level, I started to learn backend developement languages like java and node js. At that time I integrated such like simple backend logics on the serverside.

And for now I am very familar with both backend and frontend side, and by using stacks like react and react native for frontend and nodejs and java for serverside.

And I would like to say 60% is frontend and 40% is backend for me.

Regarding my technical background, I mainly work with javascript and typescript and frameworks like react and react native for frontend, and node js and java for server side And their frameworks like Next, Gatsby and express, nest and spring framework

Before that I’ve expertise skill at javascript and typescript. and other skills like redux, graphql. and mysql mongodb postresql for database.

What is **Ideal environment you are looking for?**

I am a big fan of working from home, which is very flexible job type and a great option during this pandemic, And usually process a daily standup at 10 am which is the best time i think, 

And I was always provided flexible deadline from my previous companies, so I like it most,

**Why you left your last company**

The contract between me and the last company was expired last ** because at that time there was an emergency family issue and I asked for a short vacation to the company but the company didn’t allow that because at that time there was an urgent ongoing project, so I couldn’t communicate with them for 2 weeks, and finally the contract was expired.

**Tell me about your project**

Well When I was a member of my last company, We built financial website services for customers. 

The purpose of this website was to provide professional accounting services, document processing such kind of invoices and bill documents and business analytics platform

There were 18 members in my team.

I worked as a fullstack developer in that company. ~~and always worked on CI/CD pipeline.~~

We used react redux, bootstrap scss, for frontend and nodejs mongodb for server-side. My main role was to build frontend pixel perfect landing pages with responsive design to adapt to any devices and integrated api end points to make pages sensible.

And also on the backend side I built restful api interfaces for various purposes of client users and **integrated some backend logics.**

Regarding on the backend logics, we analyzed the income from hundred’s of thousand of each user’s invoices and predict the next month or next year’s income.

At first we used K-Means(used for Clustering Model) algorithm which is highly popular and high-speed algorithm you know.

We separated each invoices depending on their types like Sales Invoice, Overdue Invoice Retainer Invoice etc and  after we applied K-Means algorithm to this separated sets.

It was the first version and now maybe they are developing the second version.

**What is the motivation to work as a web developer**

The motivation is, wWell my favourite programming language is Java in which I am currently working, Programming is fun and challenging at the same time. So the spirit of solving problems and a can-do attitude motivates me in programming, Usually enjoy doing coding and like the way it provides me support to solve real life problems.

So focusing on the motivation, I would say coding is my hobby.

**What motivates you to apply to this role**

I like to learn the ins and outs of operating the business, I enjoy improving my communication skills, and I’d love to share the workplace with other young and motivated people.

Such a company culture is highly motivating for me, and since I want to keep the job in the company and to progress further in my career, I am motivated to work hard and to try my best each day in the job.

### **What I'm looking for in my new role:**

- [ ]  I would like work on a team where pairing is encouraged for all levels
- [ ]  Be part of a diverse team
- [ ]  Highly communicative team that spreads positivity and knowledge
- [ ]  Implements an agile workflow
- [ ]  Relevant and latest tech(where needed)

## **What is most important to you in your next position?**

Three things that I’m looking for in my next job are a collaborative, team-focused culture, opportunities to learn and grow my skills from a technical standpoint, and a chance to learn more leadership skills over time. After reading the job description for this role, it sounds like this could be a good match for what I’m looking for, so I was excited to come interview for the position and learn more.

**The Steps after you receive tickets.**

When I receive ticket, I normally make a call with someone who gave ticket, during the meeting I check the ticket’s requirements and stacks again and if it is fit to my technical stacks and deadline.

If I make sure all of those requirements, first I separate them into mini tasks and make a task list myself like Trello or Jira, I normally use notion to implement this. and I process each task one by one, If I finish one mini task, I review the result myself comparing with the best practices and check if I used best algorithms to implement that task. And also there maybe some small challenges with tasks so in that case I don’t hesitate to ask to team members

When I finish all the mini tasks, I merge them and present it. 

**What do you expect from out company?**

My expectations for the company would be to **provide a work environment in which I can contribute to the team, I receive appreciation for my contributions, I have job stability and the ability to grow with the company.**

**Why are you applying for this opportunity?**

Well I’ve checked out the technical stacks and i think I am great fit for this opportunity and regarding on your company business, (…)

**What was the most challenging part of your career?**

When I first started as a front-end web developer, the amount of learnings which I need to do were enormous. The code documentation were very limited. At that time, I didn't really have a mentor to help me through the learning process so I had to learn by myself most of the time. Plus, I was given a lot of tasks which were quite hard with a limited time budget. How could I survive then?

One of my senior gave a cool method which she always used it in her daily works. It turned out she relied heavily on a “search in directory” tool to learn many parts of the codebase. From there, I learned to use that method too along with Google search. After an intensive search, tons of explorations and experiments, I became used to learn a codebase in a short time on many kinds of programming languages.

This was the most challenging part of my career.

**What is the most important to your in your next job?**

Having a say in what I work on and how I work

Having a say in the company's and/or my team's direction

**Mentorship opportunities**

**What is your expected working environment?**

I expect the environment which I can get Clear role and set of responsibilities and receive

Consistent feedback from management

**Thing before you start a project.**

# **Step #1: Get clear on the scope, the why and the objective of the project**

**Before we begin, we need to be clear on what out project is, why we’re doing it and what we hope the outcome will be.**

**I’ve seen too many entrepreneurs start something just because it seemed like a good idea in the moment or they saw someone else do it and figured they should too. This is not a strategic way to make decisions in business.**

**Any project we start takes effort, resources and time — all that could be allocated to something else — so making sure what we’re embarking on is the best strategic move for your business**

# **Step #2: Develop your project plan**

**Please don’t begin a project hoping to keep all the details in your head. I promise, you can’t (nor should you). Likewise, don’t work at a project without clear deadlines and milestones, otherwise you’ll find yourself constantly pushing out the completion date by another week or another week or another week.**

**Instead, build out an easy-to-follow project plan that will give you a roadmap for the duration of the project. Just like you wouldn’t try to travel across the country without a map, a project plan will show you all the key points you need to stop at along the way, and keep you on course when it gets hard.**

**Send me the plan**We respect your privacy. Unsubscribe at anytime.

# **Step #3: Turn on the blinders for maximum creativity**

**It seems to be a law of the universe that the *minute* you make a decision about a direction, suddenly it feels like everyone else is doing that same thing too. You go online and see your peers or competitors announcing their newest project – which sounds a lot like your big idea – and it takes the wind out of your sails.**

**First, remember that there is more than enough to go around. Someone else may be doing the same work as you, but not the way you do it. The world needs your voice.**

**Next, please, for the love of everything good, turn on the blinders. Go dark. Unsubscribe. Take social media icons off your phone. Do whatever you need to do to turn down the noise so you can concentrate fully on your project without being influenced or taken down by others doing similar work.**

**What is your definition of an ideal day?**
A unit for estimating the size of product backlog items based on how long an item would take to complete if it were the only work being performed, there were no interruptions, and all resources necessary to complete the work were immediately available.
