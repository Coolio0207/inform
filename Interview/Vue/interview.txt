Hi Dmitry,
I have 8 years of experience with Vue.js.
When it was first publised in 2014, I am very much interested in this new JavaScript framework and I have studied .
I have extensive experience with this language.
I am very much familiar with Vue.js, Vue2 and Vue3.

When it comes to Vue3, there are three APIs(Global API, Options API and Composition API).
the composition API is the new api and I am very much experienced with this.
Also when it comes to store of Vue, in the past I used Vuex but I use Pinia for store.
With this Pinia I can create multiple stores that can be imported into components directly where they're needed.
This allows bundlers to better code split and provides better TypeScript inferences.
