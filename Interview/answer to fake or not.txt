Yeah , Ok.
Give me a chance to answer to that question.
I was born in China and my mother is chinese.
But my father is xxx.
My parents were students of Chonghwa university and my father was an exchange student.
They married after graduate the university of Science and Technology and that is why I was born in china and speak like a chinese.

When I was 5  ,my mother and I moved to xxx with my father.
