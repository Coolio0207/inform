For the NFT dApp, I keep 4 steps to complete the project.
1. Generate NFT arts based on image layers
2. Build NFT dApp website using Figma or reference sites
3. Write, audit & deploy the smart contract for NFT functions and utilities.
4. Integrate website with smart contract and launch it on the mainnet.
