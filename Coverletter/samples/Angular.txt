This website aims to find sports facilities from football pitches to tennis courts in a range of cities across the UK and Ireland.
There are over 10 thousand users.
This website is built with the MEAN stack.
I took part in developing this site and there, I implemented frontend using Angular, chart using chart.js , search using search engine-Elasticsearch.
The biggest challenge was using Observables.
I used Angular version 6.1.8
Observable in Angular is a feature that provides support for delivering messages between different parts of your single-page application.
This feature is frequently used in Angular because it is responsible for handling multiple values, asynchronous programming in Javascript.
It is different from Promise.
The biggest difference is that Promises won't change their value once they have been fulfilled. 
They can only emit (reject, resolve) a single value. On the other hand, observables can emit multiple results. 
The subscriber will be receiving results until the observer is completed or unsubscribed from.
this.league$.subscribe( l => {this.setRandomPlayer(l.leagueId);});
