I manage to loop through products and do dynamic appearing on cart drawer with multiple conditions provided from the client. This is done on Shopify platform using liquid, html, css and jquery.
I also developed cart drawer feature from scratch and did a lot of css stylings to it to make it look and function good on all devices/screens/browsers.
The cart drawer is also now displaying multiple product info and displays different products once new ones are added/removed.
I also implemented 10second timer on top.
