Please allow me explain about my experience in Prestashop.
I built an e-commerce site using Prestashop. 
So far, I built many e-commerce site using Magento , Shopify and Prestashop.
Preshashop is easier to use than Magento.
The advantage of Prestashop is more suitable for small and medium-size stores and it can offer the most customization and ability to sell internationally.
PrestaShop is a great option for merchants who not only want to take advantage of the flexibility of the open-source nature but also appreciate the ease of use when it comes to store management, SEO, inventory and so on.
I am very much interested in Prestashop and I am confident in Prestashop jobs.
Please contact to me and have a detailed discussion.
