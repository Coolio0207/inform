What is my experience with Ruby and Elixir?
Elixir is better than Ruby.
Let me explain why.
Ever since I first tried building projects with Elixir, I have come to appreciate how functional languages lead to a much more maintainable codebase. So apart from the large performance gains of shifting to Elixir from Ruby, the more valuable gain is in the way of maintainability of your code. This is due to stateless modules, state management being isolated into specific parts of your code, no complex class hierarchies, etc...

When comparing Phoenix to Ruby on Rails, I find Rails a lot more bloated. It has provided a lot of 'conveniences' that are just not worth their costs in complexity. It takes a lot less to learn and understand Phoenix than Ruby on Rails. Phoenix follows the same principle of 'Convention over Configuration' and provides you with the scaffolding you need to immediately start building features for your web app. So far, it does just enough and does not do too much 'magic' as Rails does. It's a lot easier diving into the source of Phoenix than it is with Rails.
