Please allow me explain about my experience with Ghost platform .
In my experience, Ghost is similar to WordPress.
Ghost is a simple platform - it isn't power than WordPress instead, it is purely a blogging platform.
It is only used for blogs.
I have developed carsoup using Ghost.
Carsoup helps everybody find the perfect car or truck AND the perfect price!
As you know there are over 120 themes in Ghost5 and I used SOLO theme for carsoup.
There I also implemented accessible is good for Color blind and Screen Reader using the main function of Ghost - Code Injection!
This Ghost is very comfortable for building blogging page.
