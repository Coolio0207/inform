I am very much interested in this job because I have very extensive experience in this no code database tool.
Could you take a look at 
https://baserow.io 
https://kintone.com .
1.Baserow is an open-source online database tool.
It is very similar to Micro Soft Excel.
Users can use this no-code platform to create a database without any technical experience. 
There ,users can create tables, integrate other tables and add functions without technical experience.
I am very much interested in baserow.io because it's  faster and cheaper to build.
2.Kintone
Could you please visit Kintone? Then you will be noticed that it is very similar to Knack.
I also have an experience in Kintone which is a no-code business application platform that allows non-technical users to create powerful apps, workflows, and databases for their teams and organizations.
I have an experience in Kintone and there I have developed over 40 apps with 100 views .
I am really confident in this project and I am sure I can do it.
