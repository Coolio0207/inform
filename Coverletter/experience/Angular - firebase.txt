Please let me explain about my previous project.
This is a simple website that does auction on website.
The title is "Fantasy Football Auction" and this is using Angular for frontend and Cloud Firebase for database.
There, I used Angular version 10 and realtime firebase database.
The problem was integrating ng and realtime database( There are two types of database in Firebase -FireStore and Realtime) and token generation.
It took  a week to complete this project and the client(Tyler Weltzin) was fully satisfied.
I am confident in Projects that are similar to my experience.
