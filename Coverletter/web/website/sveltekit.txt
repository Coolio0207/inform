I see from your requirements you are looking for a SvelteKit expert who can help you.
I am an experienced SvelteKit developer with over 6 years experience .I started studying and developing when the Svelte was first born in 2016.
I am certainly sure I can help you with your requirements.

Here are my projects.

-The Svelte is also good but it doesn't have as much flexibility as React. Data must get updated in real DOM structure. However, the real DOM allows Svelte to provide a faster user experience compared to React thanks to proper optimization. So the lack of a virtual dom diffing does not stop it from being useful.
-write less code , no virtual dom , Truly reactive
