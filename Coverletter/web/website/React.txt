Hello,

After reading your requirements, I found that my skill set and relevant work experience best fit for this project.

Your project reminds me of one of my previous projects, Busright a US-based startup. This is an online Schools Bus Tracking web application used to administer the bus routes, live tracking of the bus, manage the process, etc. You can try out the web app here: https://busright.com

I have worked along with a team of two backend developers on this project, where we followed agile methodology with daily scrum calls and weekly sprint meetings. My responsibility was to develop the custom reusable react frontend components and backend API integration.

I have over 9 years of experience in developing web applications, and for over 4 years, I have been using ReactJS for frontend development. As ReactJS frontend developer I can help you with:

>> Translating design documents and wireframes into high-quality, reusable components
>> Building, maintaining, and supporting a library of reusable components
>> Integration on GraphQL/Restful APIs
>> Strong source control skills ( Git ), including branching strategies and merging
>> Project management using Slack, Trello, Jira, or Asana.

I’d love to hear more about the project, and explore if we’d be a good fit to work together. Can you hop on a 5-10 minute call to discuss this?

Thanks for taking the time to read my application, I am waiting to hear back from you.
