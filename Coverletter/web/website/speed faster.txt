Hello . 
I came across your job posting very carefully and it looks like best match with my background.  
I see you are looking for a developer who can optimize your expecting website. right? I can do it! There are several ways to optimize.

I am going to do 
1.Compress and optimize your images
2.Eliminate unnecessary plugins.
3.Use asynchronous and defer loading for your CSS and JavaScript files. 

Methods:
1.I know you are going to use Tailwind Css so there will be useless codes 
2.I know you are going to upload many images and videos , this will affect to speed. So I will compress these.

Regards.
