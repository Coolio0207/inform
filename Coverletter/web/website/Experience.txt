I used Vue.js, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, AWS in developing this online shop.
I improved the UI of the existing admin tool to create more personalized consumer experiences. Next, I introduced a new feature to accelerate the time to purchase. Also, I conducted automated build testing and embedded the AWS to speed up the software development lifecycle and provide more visibility into app performance.

I used React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Heroku in developing this investing platform.
I first evaluated and refactored product code to increase agility, security, and speed across the entire development life cycle.
Next, I engineered three advanced recordkeeping modules â€” for companies, employees, and Vestwellâ€™s own operational team â€” as well as integrated the clientâ€™s existing infrastructure with third-party HR and payroll systems.
I also implemented integrations with the Voya and Franklin financial platforms.
