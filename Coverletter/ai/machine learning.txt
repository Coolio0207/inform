Dear my client, I have read your project and I am glad to connect to you. I hope we could talk about your project more detail. I am working as AI developer for 2 years in Vietnam. I have completed several projects using face detection, face recognition technology such as eKYC and smart camera (use face recognition for face verification and face identification). The projects have been released to my clients and we have received great feedback from them. So that your project would definitely be benefited by my experience. Here is my Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/duong-dang-quy-07475a168/ For your project, I could apply my experience to complete it I hope we could have a conversation to discuss more. My proposed rate may be changed when we have detail road map and scheduler. Best regards, Duong Duong Dang Quy

Hello! Machine Learning and AI work such a Video surveillance software, Video analytics, live steaming, camera apps, object recognition & tracking software, face identification, smart city solutions, drone apps, CCTV camera monitoring apps & VMS development is our core specialty, we are very well versed to help you with your task. Below are just a few relevant cases. DSI Drones - The camera will monitor surroundings Built VALT: https://ipivs.com/ - Software-as-a-Service video surveillance system for enterprises. It’s in use at about 200+ companies and features streaming video from 9 IP cameras per room, recording and archiving of videos. You can also pan, tilt, and zoom cameras remotely and speak through a camera to the room where it’s installed. The system is a big success and makes 7.2 Million USD in Revenue a year according to public info on Crunchbase Watch these awesome case study videos of the system in use: - for police interviews: https://vimeo.com/156422555 - for medical learning: https://vimeo.com/126973561 We've participated in the development of a web version for http://netcamstudio.com - top IP camera software. Monitor your home or office at any time through IP camera. Media Manipulation Engine - To simplify their editing, we recognize objects in the video, track it, and automatically add points to the project timelines when some events happen with the object. An app that allows remote p2p real-time video, audio and text communication of inmates and “visitors”. The app is installed on special tablets that are allowed to use on premises. This project involves working with all types of connection web, Voip, Sip on old mobile devices. One of the features includes computer vision - object recognition of IDs of the clients. For your product we recommend: WebRTC+Kurento or 3rd party solution for audio and video Swift for Native iOS application Kotlin for Native Android application AI/ML, Neural Networks, inbuilt libraries React.js/HTML5 for the admin panel Node.js for the server-side Socket.io for real-time features and Chat MongoDB for database

Hello sir and hope you are doing well, I am deep learning and machine learning engineer with more than 6 years of experience in Artificial intelligence and embedded systems. My main expertise lies in deep learning for computer vision, natural language processing and time series models also I am aware of almost all the algorithms used in the industry. Fortunately, I have developed many machine learning and deep learning projects and systems, since I am also a freelancer on another platform Fiverr (https://www.fiverr.com/arsalanwasim/do-your-machine-learning-tasks) My main expertise lies in image detection systems and I can develop your face tracker using: - Yolo and yolo tiny - mobilenet face detection - opencv face detection system - MTCNN face detection system with high accuracy and many more Let us discuss more in chat or call. I would appreciate the opportunity to get in touch with you. Regards, Arsalan Waseem

Hello, I am a developer with over 7 years of experience working across the stack on everything from full stack engineering to Machine Learning. I started freelancing recently and has been looking for opportunities where I can put my years of experience and expertise to good use and this project looks like one. After going through you project I understand that you are not just looking for someone who can write up an algorithm for face detection or develop a model for the same. You need someone who can do both of those while creating a complete application to integrate those functionalities. My background as a full stack engineer and as an ML engineer would help you immensely in that. What I can deliver to you is a complete application that can monitor live video streams, detect face with more than 95% accuracy and give you alerts/notification as required. I believe establishing a webhooks connection between our cloud model, assuming we are deploying it to the cloud and not locally would do the trick and would continously monitor every frame to give us a fully working detection model with notifications that are pushed when the webhook connection finds a match to the face in our database. Would love to talk more technical specifics after understanding each and every one of your requirements. Looking forward to working together, Thanks and Regards Ananda Sai A
