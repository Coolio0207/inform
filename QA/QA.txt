Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

I will use a QA process to help you detect areas for improvement and optimization. This means the final product or service will have been tried and tested through continuous feedback loops.



Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

A Test approach is a method to implement in a project and describe how testing would be achieved.
Different Test Approches:
-Active and heuristic approaches
-Consulting approaches
-Methodical approach, which is predicated on Fail Test Cases.
Improving QA:
-Firstly we create Strategy then test the Products and Applications.
-Create Test Sheet
-Create Test cases
-When developers fix the bugs, retesting is mandatory.

Testing QA:
we should use manual test and automatically test with testing tool(eslint or other library)
Improving QA:
Firstly we create Strategy then test the Products and Applications.
-Create Test Sheet
-Create Test cases
-regression test after developer fixed


Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

Before pushing to the main-net we run countless tests on local blockchains and test-nets. We also have an independent in-house auditing team that designs custom test scripts to run against every smart contract we produce to verify each function from the simplest of variables to complex time locking algorithms.


Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

I am well versed with writing tests and testing framework.


Describe your approach to testing and improving QA

- Unit and e2e tests
- Manual testing based on existed and new test cases
- Support and update test plan
