When it comes to Retool I have rich experience with this.
My Last engagement was ended last Saturday and here is the link.
https://vinsyt.com
There I worked on "vinsyt media inspector" and it was to CRUD.
There are three filter fields (Year, Model and Make) and three types of data(image, photo and video)
For this I created a listview that has 3 tabs(image, photo and video), checkbox for multi-delete and modal for edit.
Also I implemented SMS in Retool using SendGrid, Twilio and SMTP-SendGrid.
There is User data(name, phone, email).
User's data shows in Table. There is a Text field .Select one record  and press 'send' button.
Then it is sent to email and phone.
I have huge experience with Retool and I am sure I can do it for you.
