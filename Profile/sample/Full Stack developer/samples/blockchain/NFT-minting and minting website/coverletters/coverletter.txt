~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hey!
I have extensive expertise on multiple blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, and polygon. After having worked on the Ethereum blockchain, by building Smart Contracts using Solidity and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) for automobile trading, I seem to find myself the PERFECT fit for your job. Along with this, I am familiar with multiple standards of Ethereum like ERC20 for fungible tokens and ERC721 for NFT and ERC1155 for an updated version of both NFT and fungible tokens.

I have deployed contracts on both testnets and mainnet chains and have expertise with the web3 library for react to communicate with blockchain smart contracts by using specific wallets.

You might find several proposals for this job post better than mine but end results are what matter the most!!!

I saw you are looking to build a minting website

I sent the application to this job post because I’ve been obsessed with crypto and blockchain for almost 5 years and I feel that a new NFT project can make a great positive impact in the crypto space

I also know how confusing and overwhelming it is to deal all the complexities in such a project, and to find good talent that knows what they are talking about.

Here are some examples of my work that I have developed in the past that accomplish similar outcomes to your own project:

Www.sloppybees.com - NFT Website, minting logic, frontend connection and smart contract
www.digitaltwinclub.com - NFT Website, minting logic and frontend connection, and smart contract

https://opensea.io/collection/the-cyclops-monkey-club - Smart contract written
https://opensea.io/collection/nft-the-companion - Smart contract Written

Besides being a crypto expert, i’ve also been a software developer for 10 years, having worked with clients around the world such as Burger King in the US and The Trainline in the UK, and I’m confident i’m capable of providing you a premium service on the technical part, so that you can focus solely on growing your crypto business.

Here’s what you can expect:
1. Fully Tested Smart Contracts, so that your dapp is bulletproof secure
2. Cutting Edge Web 3.0 Development, providing your users with fast and intuitive user experiences on hour Dapps
3. Timely Delivers
4. Constant and Clear Communication

I always make a point to deliver the work in time and top quality is my number one priority, so choose to work only with a few clients at each time

It is also very important to me to work with clients who have a long-term vision for their business and are passionate about it. If that sounds like you, I'll be more than happy to get to know more of you and figure out if we're a good fit

I offer you an invitation for a free consultation call where :
 
I will give feedback on your current development/design practices & strategies. I will also share my own process for delivering safe and performant crypto projects

You can choose the day and the time in the calendar link down below and i will call you in upwork ;)

https://danielsilvacrypto.youcanbook.me/

The budget proposed is a placeholder. We need to investigate the scope of the project


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi there, I'm well-versed with the smart contract, and Minting website and generating the NFT collection I would love to work on this project. I have recently completed extremely similar projects which can be verified from my Upwork profile and I'm confident that it's my core area of expertise.

Please Visit my GitHub to view the previous smart contracts I have developed: https://github.com/Ghazanferprojects/

Here are some of the best NFT minting websites I have recently created:
