Happy Thursday, ðŸ™‚



I saw you are looking to build a player gambling website with crypto



I sent the application to this job post because Iâ€™ve been obsessed with crypto and blockchain for almost 5 years and I feel that a new crypto gambling website can make a great positive impact in the crypto space



I also know how confusing and overwhelming it is to deal all the complexities in such a project, and to find good talent that knows what they are talking about.



Here are some examples of my work that I have developed in the past that accomplish similar outcomes to your own project:



www.digitaltwinclub.com - NFT Website, minting logic and frontend connection, and smart contract



https://www.nftism.com/ - NFT Website of Kenny Schachter, featuring his most notables nfts, cryptomutts, huxlxyNFT and Raffles, and merchansise. We workied on the frontend connection and smart contracts



https://pentatonic-frontend-new.vercel.app/ - NFT Marketplace webiste from Pentatonic design agency. We workied on the frontend connection and smart contracts



www.sloppybees.com - NFT Website, minting logic, frontend connection and smart contract



https://opensea.io/collection/cryptomutts-official - Smart contract written
https://opensea.io/collection/nft-the-companion - Smart contract Written



Besides being a crypto expert, iâ€™ve also been a software developer for 10 years, having worked with clients around the world such as Burger King in the US and The Trainline in the UK, and Iâ€™m confident iâ€™m capable of providing you a premium service on the technical part, so that you can focus solely on growing your crypto business.



Hereâ€™s what you can expect:
1. Fully Tested Smart Contracts, so that your dapp is bulletproof secure
2. Cutting Edge Web 3.0 Development, providing your users with fast and intuitive user experiences on hour Dapps
3. Timely Delivers
4. Constant and Clear Communication



I always make a point to deliver the work in time and top quality is my number one priority, so choose to work only with a few clients at each time
