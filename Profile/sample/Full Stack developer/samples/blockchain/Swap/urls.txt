socialswap.io is a decentralised exchange on TRON blockchain with various community based events and staking options. You can either buy SST on DEX (decentralized exchange) or buy it on ProBit (centralized exchange). For buying on the DEX, you just need to add the Chrome Extension Wallet “TronLink”. You then transfer either TRX or USDT (TRC-20) on this Wallet and buy SST on socialswap.io/swap. On ProBit you just need to sign up, go through the KYC procedure and top up your account with either BTC, ETH or USDT. You can then buy SST with BTH, ETH or USDT.

SocialSwapToken (SST), a Tron-based token that governs the activities on the platform. SocialSwap is the AMM-based Decentralized Exchange on the TRON network and it is designed to exchange one token for another directly, bypassing trading platforms and other intermediaries. To carry out exchange operations, the user does not need to create an account on the exchange, go through the KYC procedure and trust their funds to third parties. All the user needs to do is connecting the browser wallet (eg. Tronlink, Tron Wallet), select the exchange direction, and make a transaction. Next, the smart contract will automatically send the corresponding amount of Tron or tokens to the user’s account
