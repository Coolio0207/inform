Please take a look at my past React Projects and experience.

https://matruecannabis.com (React , Three.js ,  Firebase ,and  Bootstrap)
This website is a shopping site that sells flowers, oil , Pre-Rolled, Refill and other discoveries.
My client was from Switzerland and he wanted to finish this project within a month(basically - 2 weeks,  maintenance , bug fixing and updating - 1 week).
But I finished this project within 14 days and he was satisfied.
There, I used  React , Three.js ,  Firebase ,and  Bootstrap.
The  special point of this website is full screen rendering and special animations of objects.
Totally, there are 9 pages (admin page - 4 pages , user page -4 pages , dashboard - 1 page , modals(register , sign in , bag , search , language)).
The most challenging part was the animation of objects. I implemented it using three.js.

https://www.chaletretreat.com/ (React/Next.js + Node.js + MongoDB + Google Maps)
This website aims to discover lakeside cabins, cottages nestled on mountain tops, shelters for skiers and lake floating cottages all across Canada.
My Client was Canadian and this site was launched in 2021 and Chalet Retreat is now the largest stand-alone booking platform for short-term rental.
