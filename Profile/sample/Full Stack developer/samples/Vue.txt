Baserow is an open-source online database tool. Users can use this no-code platform to create a database without any technical experience.
This is very similar to Spreadsheet.
The interface looks a lot like a spreadsheet ,Microsoft Excel.
Please let me explain about a good experience in this project.
In this project we used Vue.js / Nuxt.js for frontend , Python / Django for backend , PostgreSQL for backend , Docker for lightweight and modular , Redis for in-memory.
Backend
The backend(Django) consists of the core, api and database apps.
In API we used CoreHandler, TableHandler, FieldHandler etc to implement a Web Socket API, SOAP API or any other API that we also build around the same handler.
Frontend
The frontend(Vue.js / Nuxt.js) consists of the core and database modules.
The biggest challenge was to implement multi select and single select.
