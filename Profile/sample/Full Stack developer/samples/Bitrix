Hi,
I am proficient in Bitrix.
I am very much familiar with CRM tools such as "client management", "pipeline management" and "CRM scheduling" of Bitrix24.
I have over 3 years of experience with Bitrix.

What I have done before in the one of prior project.
- Ability for the customers to text us at their existing phone number which is shared by both phone and text
- Incoming texts get attached to existing deals if phone number match, otherwise, new deal created
- Ability to text out from existing phone number shared by both phone and text
-- Text out from an existing deal
-- Initiate a text from a newly created deal (or lead)
-- Send out text to multiple contacts in a single step (assuming way to aggregate contacts)
- Open to porting phone number to new service, however, would need to still have to be able to phone and SMS using the same number
- Open to setting up a self hosted solution rather than using hosted Bitrix24
- Possible advice on ways to better use Bitrix24 for our business
