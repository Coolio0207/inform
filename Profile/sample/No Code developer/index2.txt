I am working in the IT industry for more than five years now, and I have experience in the entire web development life-cycle and enterprise Linux infrastructure management.
Even though I am a Unix Engineer, I am impressed by bubble.io, simply due to its ability to create websites within a short period of time, focusing more on the final idea instead of the programing language. Also, as an IT Engineer, I understand its capability of developing secure, scalable web applications like Airbnb, Spotify, and Twitter, or any other. It is a robust no-code framework that enables your business to go live & online within a short period.

Even though it is a no-code platform, I see many people get stuck when it comes to workflows & some interface designs. My intention is to support them to overcome those issues using my bubble knowledge & the ability to understand from a programmer’s aspect.
