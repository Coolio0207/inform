I'm a highly motivated web developer with an array of solid development skills, along with the ability to lead a project if needed.

I specialize in end to end development of software systems using latest technologies to build SaaS and web platforms of any kind. I have been involved in software design, product management, marketing, sales and also owned businesses, so I understand what it takes to translate a business need into a technical product. I especially enjoy working with entrepreneurs and startups who are looking to build an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) to raise funds or get into a new market.

I start with understanding and documenting the client requirements. Using mock-ups and some level of prototyping, the product is first designed and agreed upon. Appropriate platforms, tools and languages are evaluated that will offer the best results at the lowest cost and fastest delivery. I am very conscious about making sure we stay within budget and deliver on time, so you will get timely updates and demos of the progress of the project.

If you are looking for a partner to help you achieve your goals, I can be a very useful resource. I can work independently or with your team. My mission is to give you the best customer service. What motivates me more than anything else is to contribute to the success of others.

Thank you for visiting my profile and I can't wait to work with you.
