Hello all,

I would say I am an expert, however after taking some time off and with the web evolving as quickly as it does I decided to change my experience to intermediate.

My name is Brian Bosley and have been developing for about 10 years now. I’ve had the privilege of watching the changes and updates that happen constantly year after year. It seems that the big thing now is CMS work. Not a lot of clients want you to code a full website anymore which actually makes things easier with Wordpress, Wix, etc.. doing half of the work for you.

With most developing skills online, once you’ve learned one then you can figure out how to work with just about anything similar. That goes for writing different languages as well as using CMS, and any type of integration. If I have not used a specific program, I guarantee that I’ll figure it out with experience in a previous project.

I enjoy working remotely on a clients website using Dreamweaver the most. It may be because I have used this program for such a long time, and even though it is not the only program I use, Dreamweaver is my go to on most projects. I use all Adobe programs, as well as most developer apps, tools, platforms and software so I have the tools and experience for just about any project.
