 have more than 9 years experience as a Shopify and WordPress Expert. I have used HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP. Additionally, I have experience working with SquareSpace, Unbounce, and ClickFunnel.

I build responsive websites using these technologies so my designs/sites looks good on any device and browser. I believe in using optimized and minimal code to achieve my goals.

I have customized and designed numerous Shopify sites using premium and free themes with high-level customizations that includes Brooklyn, Shoptimized, Pop, Icon, Ella, Out of the Sandbox (Turbo, Pipeline, Retina, Parallax), Archetype themes etc. I also have worked with latest shopify 2.0 themes setup and custom functionality development includes latest features like meta fields. My clients can manage their stores after completion of work.

I have knowledge of Data structure (Google Rich Snippet) so i can fix errors of google search console which can helpful to display organized info in google search about your site or mainly about your products. I am also familiar with Facebook pixel integration and tracking with shopify.

Additionally, I can do PSD to HTML and HTML to CMS conversions to create custom one-of-a-kind templates. I am also expert in setting Up A/B test, Split test in Google Optimize Or Convert.

I have great work flow and project management skills to manage big projects adhering to deadlines.
