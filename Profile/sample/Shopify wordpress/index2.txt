I have over 15 years of experience building websites with knowledge of many applications, including WordPress, WooCommerce, Divi, Elementor, BigCommerce, Volusion, Shopify, Salesforce, Mailchimp, Shipstation, and more.

What separates me from most freelancers is my small business experience, having owned a retail store for twelve years. This entrepreneurial and marketing background enables me to create websites, digital marketing campaigns, and more, articulate in their message while achieving a client's desired business objective.

Skills include e-commerce, SEO, logo design, security and maintenance, landing page design, branding, and more.

My goal is to build long-term relationships with clients, not one-time transactions. I’m super responsive and can adjust my schedule based on your changing needs.
