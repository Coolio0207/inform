Hello,
I am a vetted expert in:
✔️API Integration
✔️JavaScript
✔️Node JS
✔️Python

I am the candidate for this position.

I’m not on here to be a salesman. I trust that you can appreciate that it has never been within my skill set, nor do I desire it to be. Salesmanship is possibly your position in running your company. As for me, I am here to work in my specialty, and what I am certain of is that I can assist you at an expert level with this work.

So, from a technical and practical perspective, my personal and company work histories are both top-of-the-line and speak for themselves, (top-rated plus and expert-vetted, top 1%, respectively). In working with me, you will achieve the same results.

Please read through these very detailed reviews that I’ve also acquired on Clutch to save us both time in the call phase of our introductory process::
https://clutch.co/profile/guaranteed-software#reviews

I’ll let that be my sales pitch and hope that after we achieve success, we recognize that we've validated that results speak louder than sales pitches and slick words.

FAQ:

I specialize in long-term partnerships with established enterprise-level businesses.

My communication is at a premium level – We can communicate in real-time via Slack, Zoom, Asana, and whatever other technologies you may use. Additionally, I make myself available via phone, which is also provided below.

Please only contact me if you are prioritizing high-end results and there is long-term potential in our work. I am not a budget service and will not be engaging in trying to underbid “third-world off-shore” firms. That is for a different person or company and for a different standard in results.

I’m looking forward to chatting!
