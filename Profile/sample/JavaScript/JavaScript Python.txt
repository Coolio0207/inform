Hi,

Thank you for visiting my profile!

Consider me an extension of your already existing tech-team, or the pilot for your next development project. I thrive at adding value where I can to help companies, or individuals, realize their development needs.

I have a breadth of experience ranging from startup MVPs to working on products for Fortune 1000 companies. I am adaptable as I am willing to jump into the ‘trenches’ to get work done.
