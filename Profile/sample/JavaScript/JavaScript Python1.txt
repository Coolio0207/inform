As a professional full-stack developer with 10+ years of experience in web development. Iâ€™m really passionate on JavaScript so my major stack is React/Node.js.

I built several projects such as Booking, Blog, Ecommerce sites and Uber-like platforms. During these projects I strived to write best practices with SOLID and DRY.
