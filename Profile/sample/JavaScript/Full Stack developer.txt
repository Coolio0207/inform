With over 11 years of web development and industry experience, I can assist you and your company in telling your unique story by establishing a strong online presence. I deliver success by going above and beyond, leaving no stone unturned. I am professional, a great communicator, work well with everyone, and will do everything possible to ensure that you are 100% satisfied with my work.

Businesses often struggle when working with both web design and digital marketing agencies. Designers donâ€™t think about conversions and SEO, and marketers donâ€™t always understand the importance of visuals, which causes this struggle.

My wife and I merge these 2 important areas of your business. I (Marko) specialize with web and full-stack development, and work together with my wife (Shaquira) who specializes in Digital Marketing. We work side-by-side to produce dynamic, professional, and visually-rich websites that are built for optimal performance, lead generation, and conversions, all while highlighting a strong brand message through digital marketing channels.

Our goal is to exceed your expectations, therefore we will not settle for just any solution, we will always strive to find the best solution tailored towards your business. Our expertise lies in the following:

- Full-Stack Web and Mobile App development
- WordPress website development (I can develop from scratch with HTML/CSS/JS too ðŸ˜‰)
- SEO
- Social Media Marketing/Management: IG, LinkedIn, FB, FB Ads
