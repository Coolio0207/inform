Hi there!

I am a full-stack web developer and UI/UX designer with several years of professional experience.

I use the most cutting-edge technologies to create fast, sleek, responsive, SEO-optimized marketing/e-commerce websites and web apps. I have extensive experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node, and popular modern frameworks such as Next.js and Gatsby. I also have plenty of experience working within popular design tools such as Figma and Sketch.

I have partnered with people on all types of projects, such as:

- modern companies looking to expand their online presence and generate leads
- SaaS startups looking for a marketing website that converts, and/or a developer to work on their application
- DTC brands looking to create seamless shopping experience for their users


A few of my specialty areas:

1) Website design and development for individuals and companies that want a high-fidelity, fast, modern, app-like feel for their sites, with perfect SEO implementations and the ability to seamlessly edit and add to their site's content via Content Management System.

2) Custom e-commerce sites where custom branding, site speed, and SEO are paramount.

3) Design and development of web applications using modern frameworks.

The ideal project for me is one where we are put the work in early to establish a strong design and vision, then maintain strong communication to ensure an amazing result on a deadline that works for you.

Feel free to get in touch!
